        User administration allows organisations to manage platform users to ensure people are only able to perform the actions they are authorised to perform. komgo gives organisations the ability to define their own roles to reflect the organisation's own operations, and to manage how these roles are assigned to users.

        Counterparty Management
       </dt> 
       <dd>
        Counterparty management allows komgo users to manage the other organisations with whom they interact on the platform (counterparties). komgo enables organisations to "request" to connect with other organisations on the platform; similar to a facebook friend request. Counterparty management is critical to ensuring that sensitive information is only sent to organisation \(counterparties\) with whom your organisation has agreed to share information.

       <dd>
        The Trade Finance feature facilitates both processes for applying for financing, and the subsequent issuing and sharing of the resulting instrument. komgo simplifies this process for all parties by providing a secure manner for commodities traders to share the documentation required for a finance application. After acceptance thereof, komgo enables the issuing bank to create the financing instrument on the platform, and securely share it with all the relevant stakeholders.
